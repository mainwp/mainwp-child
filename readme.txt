== HOW DOES THE MAINWP WORK? ==

First, Install and Activate the [MainWP WordPress Manager Dashboard](https://wordpress.org/plugins/mainwp/) plugin on a WordPress site you will use for controlling all other sites; this is your Dashboard Site.

We highly recommend this be a new, clean WordPress installation and not on one of your operating sites. Using a clean site helps to eliminate any unnecessary plugin conflicts or security issues.

Next, Install and Activate the MainWP Child plugin (this plugin) on all the WordPress sites you want to connect to your MainWP Dashboard. WordPress sites connected to your Dashboard are referred to as Child Sites.

Once connected, you can manage them from your MainWP Dashboard.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==
= Do I need any other plugins for MainWP? =
Yes, you need to install the [MainWP WordPress Manager Dashboard](https://wordpress.org/plugins/mainwp/) on a new WordPress site or subdomain.

= Do you have any documentation? =
Yes, please review the [documentation site](https://kb.mainwp.com).

= I just want to start using MainWP, do you have a Quick Start Guide? =
Yes, please read the [Quick Start – Setting up your MainWP](https://kb.mainwp.com/docs/set-up-the-mainwp-plugin/) guide on the doc site.

= Where do I go for support or to ask for help? =

= What is the difference between ManageWP and MainWP? =
Essentially MainWP and ManageWP provide the same type of service but with different philosophies on WordPress management.

ManageWP is a Service as a Solution (SaaS) property owned by Godaddy.  The SaaS system makes ManageWP a type of "Walled Garden" with limited customization options.

MainWP follows the tradition of WordPress and is [open source](https://github.com/mainwp/mainwp-child/), [private](https://mainwp.com/protect-your-data/), and [fully extendable](https://mainwp.dev/). .   The fact that MainWP is open source and extendable means you have almost unlimited customization option, this allows you to run your WordPress management business as you see fit.

= How do I know my sites are secure using MainWP? =
We take security very seriously at MainWP. We welcome any peer review of our [100% open source code](https://github.com/mainwp/mainwp-child/) to ensure nobody's MainWP management system is ever compromised or hacked.

We also participate in the [HackerOne](https://www.hackerone.com) bug bounty program; this allows ethical hackers to review MainWP code and directly share any vulnerability information with us in return for a monetary reward.

= How do I customize MainWP for my needs? =
If you want to make some basic changes to the look of your Dashboard, you can use our prebuilt [Custom Dashbboard](https://mainwp.com/extension/mainwp-custom-dashboard-extension/) Extension, or if you want to dig in and build Extensions, you can learn all about Extension creation at [MainWP.dev](https://mainwp.dev/)

= I have an idea for MainWP; how do I let you know? =
Please follow the steps outlined in the [MainWP Feature Requests](https://managers.mainwp.com/c/feature/16) so you can add your idea to the MainWP Community to be voted on.
