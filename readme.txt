== HOW DOES THE MAINWP WORK? ==

First, Install and Activate the [MainWP WordPress Manager Dashboard](https://wordpress.org/plugins/mainwp/) plugin on a WordPress site you will use for controlling all other sites; this is your Dashboard Site.

We highly recommend this be a new, clean WordPress installation and not on one of your production sites. Using a clean site helps to eliminate any unnecessary plugin conflicts or security issues.

Next, Install and Activate the MainWP Child plugin (this plugin) on all the WordPress sites you want to connect to your MainWP Dashboard. WordPress sites connected to your Dashboard are referred to as Child Sites.

Once connected, you can manage them from your MainWP Dashboard.

Still not sure how MainWP works? [Review these detailed steps on installing your Dashboard and connecting your first Child Site.](https://mainwp.com/getting-started-with-mainwp/)

== Frequently Asked Questions ==
= Do I need any other plugins for MainWP? =
Yes, you need to install the [MainWP Child Plugin](https://wordpress.org/plugins/mainwp-child/) on the sites you want to control with the Dashboard plugin.

= Do you have any documentation? =
Yes, please review the [documentation site](https://kb.mainwp.com).

= What is the difference between ManageWP and MainWP? =
Essentially MainWP and ManageWP provide the same type of service but with different philosophies on WordPress management.

ManageWP is a Service as a Solution (SaaS) property owned by GoDaddy. The SaaS system makes ManageWP a type of "Walled Garden" with limited customization options.

MainWP follows the tradition of WordPress and is [open source](https://github.com/mainwp/mainwp), [private](https://mainwp.com/protect-your-data/), and [fully extendable](https://mainwp.dev). The fact that MainWP is open source and extendable means you have almost unlimited customization options, allowing you to run your WordPress management business as you see fit.
